            Starting this paragraph with w.e comes to mind right now. Using this time to practice on understanding the reason why certain elemnts do certain functions. Also understading the importance of drawing out the blocks so when coding, i know the reasoning of the classes. First couple of week of this course was tough because work did not let me put in the practice i wanted but now that im getting settled in with my schedule of class and work, i am able to start planning my day. All around its definetly been a tough couple weeks. Love the challenge and it has only made me want this even more.

        Not sure what this paragraph will be about. Trying my hardest to remember the reasoning of the order of everything im coding is actually doing and whjy i need it. I think the easiest way for me to remember is hearing it and walking through someone doing it. Once i have seen all steps, its much easier for me to understand the concept of everything. I aghain this is all random typing. Might have a bunch of typos. Trying to enjoy this practice im getting in. It is currently 11pm and will probably go to bed soon> I have class at 9am. Today we went over layouts.

        Now is making me type another paragraph so i don't mind typing my thoughts out again. Busy day at work. 3 weeks into the RDS program at atlanta united. Having to do player evaluations every week for about 80 little players. I'm stressing, not going to lie.
